# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of the project

### Purpose
As a data visualization specialist from the Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. I created an earthquake map based on the earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. Users can get the magnitude and location of an earthquake when they click any circle marker of earthquakes. 

To make it more user-friendly, the earthquake map contains 2 groups: one is all past 7-day earthquakes information from the U.S. Geological Survey website, the other only display major earthquakes with magnitude over 4.5 from the GeoJSON Summary Feed. 

Finally, to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates fault lines were added on the map. The company hope the insightful data visualized map with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world attract users to access on their desktops and mobile phones.
